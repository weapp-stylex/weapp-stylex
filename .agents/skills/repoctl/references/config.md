# repoctl.config.ts

Preferred filename: `repoctl.config.ts`

Rule:

- Load `repoctl.config.*`; rename legacy `monorepo.config.*`, which is no longer loaded.
- Validate repoctl-owned fields before command side effects with `repo config validate --json`.
- Native tooling passthrough and callbacks keep their extension boundary. Config modules are trusted executable project code.
- Use `repo config inspect --command ai --set 'format="json"' --json` for shared defaults/project/CLI provenance. Contexts: ai, clean, create, deps, doctor, init, mirror, release, upgrade. Runtime selection is explained by each command's plan.
- Reports redact env values and native tool payloads by default; `--redact` additionally hides local paths. For programmatic safe reports use `explainMonorepoConfig` or `validateConfigFile`; runtime config APIs retain callbacks and should not be serialized for sharing.
- Replace the old ignored `tooling.lintStaged.monorepoCommand` field with `repoCommand`.
- Organization presets use `presets: [{ packageName, version }]` with an exact installed dependency and JSON-only `repoctl.preset.json`. Loading never imports package code, installs or fetches. Parents precede declaring presets, then the project and CLI; arrays replace at preset boundaries. `config inspect` exposes ordered layers and precise package/version sources.
- `repo presets inspect --json` lists recommendations and owned assets. `repo presets plan --json --out new-plan.json` is read-only; `repo presets apply new-plan.json` explicitly applies reviewed assets with three-way merge and a shared root-upgrade lock. Existing files and other provider baselines cannot be adopted implicitly. Commit `.repoctl/baselines/presets` alongside managed files.
- Preset templates enter the unified catalog as fixed npm sources from the declaring package. `repo templates fetch <key>` prepares verified assets; previews and offline creation require that cache. Capability recommendations do not apply capabilities automatically.

Use `defineMonorepoConfig` to set default options for CLI commands.
Only include the fields you need.

Example:

```ts
import { defineMonorepoConfig } from 'repoctl'

export default defineMonorepoConfig({
  commands: {
    ai: {
      baseDir: 'agentic/prompts',
      format: 'md',
      force: false,
      tasksFile: 'agentic/tasks.json',
    },
    create: {
      defaultTemplate: 'tsdown',
      renameJson: false,
      templatesDir: 'packages/monorepo/templates',
    },
    clean: {
      autoConfirm: false,
      dryRun: false,
      ignorePackages: ['docs'],
      includePrivate: true,
      pinnedVersion: 'latest',
    },
    upgrade: {
      skipOverwrite: false,
      targets: ['.github', 'repoctl.config.ts'],
      mergeTargets: true,
    },
    init: {
      skipReadme: false,
      skipPkgJson: false,
      skipChangeset: false,
      skipIssueTemplateConfig: false,
    },
    mirror: {
      env: {
        VSCode_CLI_MIRROR: 'https://example.invalid',
      },
    },
  },
})
```

Key areas:

- ai: default output, format, batch tasks
- create: default template and template directory
- clean: explicit package selection, optional read-only dryRun, private/ignored package filtering, and an explicit pinnedVersion override; existing repoctl versions are retained otherwise
- upgrade: overwrite behavior and extra targets
- init: skip steps for README/package.json/pnpm change intent setup
- mirror: add or override env mirrors

## `commands.doctor`

Validate the schema of the whole configuration before executing selected doctor rules. Omitted `rules` selects every rule; explicit `rules: []` selects none. Valid but unsatisfied unselected policies do not contribute findings. `config inspect --command doctor` and doctor both consume workspace-root policy from package directories, with explicit CLI selection taking precedence.

```ts
export default defineMonorepoConfig({
  commands: {
    doctor: {
      rules: ['root-scripts', 'commit-hooks'],
      suppressions: [{
        id: 'commit-hooks',
        reason: 'CI validates commits while the hooks migration is scheduled',
        expires: '2026-12-31',
      }],
    },
  },
})
```

Configure reasoned waivers under `commands.doctor.suppressions`. Each item needs `id` and a nonempty `reason`; optional `path` matches an exact workspace-relative finding path. Optional `expires` is an inclusive UTC date (`YYYY-MM-DD`). JSON retains the original finding status, `suppression`, `rawSummary`, and every waiver with its matched count. Only active waivers are excluded from effective `summary` and strict exit status; expired and unmatched waivers remain visible.

## TypeScript project references

Check an existing reference graph without enabling writes:

```bash
repo tooling references check --json
repo tooling references plan > references-plan.json
repo tooling references sync --dry-run
repo tooling references apply references-plan.json
repo tooling references sync
```

`check` exits with 1 for diagnostics or pending managed changes. All commands emit versioned JSON. `check`, `plan` and `sync --dry-run` never write. `apply` and `sync` require explicit `tooling.projectReferences.enabled: true`:

```ts
export default defineMonorepoConfig({
  tooling: {
    projectReferences: {
      enabled: true,
      root: 'tsconfig.json',
      projects: ['packages/*/tsconfig.json', 'apps/*/tsconfig.build.json'],
      exclude: ['packages/legacy/tsconfig.json'],
      relations: [
        { source: 'packages/app/tsconfig.json', target: 'packages/shared/tsconfig.json' },
      ],
    },
  },
})
```

The root solution and selected configs must already exist. Without `projects`, discovery selects `tsconfig.json` in each actual pnpm workspace package, including private packages; non-TS packages are skipped. Patterns are workspace-relative and can select multiple configs per package. Exclusions affect managed discovery, not existing manual references. Configs outside workspace packages are not automatically selected. The source workspace's references are never copied into generated projects.

The root aggregates selected projects. Only explicit `relations` add compilation dependencies between them: npm dependencies do not imply a TypeScript reference. TypeScript must be installed in the target workspace. Its compiler reads inherited settings and checks missing targets, reference cycles, `composite`, declaration output and `noEmit` compatibility before writes. repoctl never enables composite, changes compiler options, creates tsconfigs or replaces scripts. The plan lists validation commands, preserving each package's existing `typecheck` script (including `vue-tsc`); run them after synchronization to check actual source files. Planning validates configuration, not a full source compilation.

Existing references remain manually owned. Only newly added entries are recorded in `.repoctl/typescript-references.json`; commit that registry alongside the tsconfigs. Removing or excluding a project removes only entries recorded there. Editing/removing an owned entry blocks synchronization: restore it, or deliberately remove its registry entry to return ownership to the user. JSONC content outside the `references` value, BOM and line endings are preserved. Root aggregation and explicit edges produce stable relative config-file paths.

Saved plans include input fingerprints and exact diffs. Applying a stale or edited plan fails before writes; reapplying an already completed plan is a no-op. A process lock at `.repoctl/typescript-references.lock` covers revalidation, writing, verification, rollback and cleanup. Changes stage together with backups and roll back on failure. If concurrent edits prevent safe rollback, the error names retained recovery files: preserve them, reconcile the business edit with the original backup, restore the ownership registry consistently and generate a new plan. A killed process can also leave `.repoctl-references-*.bak`/`.tmp` files; verify no writer remains, reconcile matching backups and the registry, then remove the stale lock. No recovery action overwrites a concurrent edit automatically.
